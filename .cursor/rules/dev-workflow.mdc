## Advantages of this merged rule
- Clear separation: Mandatory rules (commit messages) vs. reference guidance (workflow).
- Clear instructions: Each section states what it means for the assistant and how to act.
- Completeness: Consolidates stack, commands, standards, and notes in one place.
- Practicality: Enables consistent "what's next" steps and valid commit messages on demand.

## Purpose
- Reliable local workflow: lint → typecheck → commit → push, leveraging existing root scripts.

## Prerequisites
- Package manager: Bun
- Monorepo task runner: Turbo (invoked by root scripts)
- Lint/format: Biome (invoked by root scripts)
 

## Development workflow (reference)
This section is reference guidance for suggested actions when asked "what should we do next?". For optional secret scanning, see `security-scan.mdc`.

### 1) Lint
```bash
bun run lint
```

If lint fails:
```bash
# 1st fallback: auto-fix
bun run lint:fix && bun run lint

# 2nd fallback: unsafe fix
bun run lint:unsafe && bun run lint

# If it still fails, perform manual fixes and re-run lint
```

### 2) Typecheck
```bash
bun run typecheck
```

If typecheck fails:
stop agent
ask what should you do?

### 3) Create Commit
```bash
git add -A
```

### 4) Commit Message
```bash
# 1. Review changes in parts and stage them selectively
git diff           # review all changes first
git add -p         # stage changes in logical chunks

# 2. Analyze staged changes with a summary
git diff --cached --stat   # see which files changed and how many lines
git diff --cached          # view detailed diff

# 3. Write a detailed commit message
git commit --verbose       # open editor with staged diff shown for context

# Suggested commit message structure:
# type(scope): short summary (≤50 characters)
#
# - Explain why this change was made and what it addresses.
# - Reference issue number if applicable (Closes #123)
```

**Important**: Always review all changed files and create a commit message that accurately reflects the scope of changes. Don't focus on just one small change when multiple files and features are modified.

### 5) Push
```bash
git push -u origin $(git branch --show-current)
```

## Git & Version Control Standards
This section is mandatory when the assistant is asked to generate a commit message.

### Purpose
- Standardize commit messages for readability, automation (changelogs/versioning), and clean history.

### Conventional Commits

#### Message structure
- Format: `type(scope): subject`
- Example: `feat(auth): add password reset for users`
- Example: `fix(ui): fix primary button on mobile`

#### Allowed types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Code style/formatting that doesn’t affect meaning
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Add or fix tests
- `build`: Build system or external dependencies changes
- `chore`: Other routine tasks

#### Scope (optional)
- Area of change: `auth`, `api`, `ui`, `organization`, `competency`, etc.

#### Subject rules
- Start with lowercase, no trailing period
- Use imperative mood: “add”, “fix”, “update”
  - Correct: `add a new feature`
  - Incorrect: `added a new feature` / `adding a new feature`

#### Body & Footer (when needed)
- Body: Explain the why/how; wrap lines at ~72
- Footer:
  - Breaking changes: `BREAKING CHANGE: ...`
  - Issue references: `Closes #123`, `Refs: #456`

#### Examples
```text
feat(competency): add form fields for basic info step

fix(ui): fix focus state on mobile header search

refactor(shared): simplify date formatting helpers

docs(readme): update developer setup steps

perf(table): reduce render cost on large lists via virtualization

test(analytics): add unit tests for participant charts
```

### Push guidelines
- Push only after lint and typecheck pass (follow this file’s flow).
- Prefer atomic and meaningful commits; squash trivial ones.
- Do not push secrets/PII; use environment variables.
- Push after completed `feat`/`fix`; use draft PRs for WIP.
- Note: `git push` cannot be bound to a rule; treat this as best practice after successful checks.

## Notes
- Prefer atomic commits; keep PRs focused (see `code-quality.mdc` for PR checklist).
- If additional package-level checks are needed, wire them into Turbo and expose via root scripts.
